# Roadmap

## Stuff to add

1. Implement an action capable of initializing a lightweight `baraddur.yml` template file.
2. Implement a counter that allows to track completion
   **Note**: this needs to be implemented as a separate channel and some counters
3. Make it possible to ignore failure (or even raise critical if a given scan fails)
4. Tests: Test the code
5. GitHub actions
6. Dockerfile
7. Publishing of releases (Understand `goreleaser`)
8. Publishing of Docker Image
9. A proper README.
10. Be able to prevent pattern searching downwards -> Just match end of string?
11. [MUST] Example use-case: git grep history and blame
14. [MUST] Be able to pass arbitrary arguments to job
